The first word clock was designed with a ATMEGA328, combined with a rotary, DCF77 receiver, a accurate Ds3231 RTC klok module and a Bluetooth module.
The design was greatly simplified with the use of Arduino Nano and WS2812 and SK6812 RGB colour LEDs.

with the Arduino Nano and WS2812 and SK6812 RGB color leds the design became a lot simpler. 

The arrival of the ESP32 was superior to the Arduino mcu's with WIFI and bluetooth working both simutaniously. But with too many short living boards with different foorprints, sizes and, often to less, pins no suitable satisfying design could be made.

The Arduino Nano ESP32 with S3 processor was the promising Arduino product. 

Maintaining the source code for the White LED and RGB LED clocks was a time-consuming task. The white LED clock, which has been running in numerous clocks for over 10 years, has been built by many people and proved to be very solid.

The RGB(W) clock made it possible to nuilt a 4-language clock with 625 LEDs. The one language designs are much easier to built and can also give a pure white display and if wished also in any colour.

This is the ultimate fusion of all clocks; one PCB and one source code.<br>
The PCB's were kindly supported by [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com) that made the development of this PCB possible.<br>
The PCB was designed with Fritzing and the Gerber files uploaded to PCBWay. Delivery to The Netherlands in a week. Piece of cake.<br>

In the [PDF](https://github.com/ednieuw/NanoESP32-BW-RGBW-clock/blob/main/NanoESP32-PCB.pdf) the solder instructions are documented.
