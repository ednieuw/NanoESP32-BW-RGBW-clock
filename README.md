# NanoESP32-BW-RGBW-clock
One PCB, one source code for 2835/3528 BW and SK6812/WS2812 RGB(W) LED-strips

The first word clock was designed with a ATMEGA328, combined with a rotary, DCF77 receiver, a accurate Ds3231 RTc klok module and a bluetooth module.

with the Arduino Nano and WS2812 and SK6812 RGB color leds the design became a lot simpler. 

The arrival of the ESP32 was superior to the Arduino mcu's with WIFI and bluetooth working both simutaniously. But with too many short living boards with different sizes and, often to less, pins no suitable satisfying design could be made.

The Arduino Nano ESP32 with S3 processor was the promising Arduino product. 

Keeping the source code of the White LED and RGB LED clock was time consuming. The white LED clock is a very that runs in many clocks for over 10 years and is built bymany people. 

The RGB(W) clock made it possible to nuilt a 4-language clock with 625 LEDs. The one language designs are much easier to built and can also give a pure white display and if wished also in any colour.

This is the ultimate fusion of all clocks; one pcb and one source code.<br>
The PCB design was kindly supported by [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com) that made the development of this PCB possible.<br>
The PCB was designed with Fritzing and the Gerber files uploaded to PCBWay. Piece of cake.<br>
